## Introduction
We proposed a conditional classifier generative adversarial nets (CCGAN) for the classification task.
Unlike the previous works on GAN for image generation or semi-supervised GAN, the CCGAN uses real samples as conditional information to the generator network of GAN, and adds categorical output related to class labels as output to the discriminator network, in addition to “Real/Fake” output. The generator and discriminator networks are optimized by jointly minimizing the “Real/Fake” objective function and categorical classification objective function.
The generator can be considered as a feature transformation that supplies additional information to improve the generalization of the discriminator network for classification.
Compared with dropout and data augmentation methods, the proposed method obtained 29.7% and 31.8% relative improvement
on NIST 2015 i-vector challenge data set for spoken language identification.

## Proposed Method: Conditional Classifier GAN

The proposed framework has the following characteristics:

1) Unlike the conditional GAN using class labels as conditional information, the framework can be directly used for the classi-
fication task using real samples as conditional information.  

2) The generated features can be optimized and selected automatically to improve regularization of the model for the classification task.

## Experiment Results

The i-vector data based on NIST 2015 language recognition i-vector machine learning challenge were used for examination.
